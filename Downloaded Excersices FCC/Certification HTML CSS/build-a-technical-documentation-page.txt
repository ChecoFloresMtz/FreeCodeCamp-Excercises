Tensions between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the allied countries of the recently-introduced Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT) are at an all-time high, coming to a head in the Pacific. Meanwhile, on the small island Republic of Altis and Stratis, NATO forces are preparing to hand over responsibility for the security of the Republic to the armed forces of the local government, along with an immediate drawdown of all forces and equipment. Many, however, remain skeptical as to the wisdom of such a move.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Main_History">
        <header>Main History</header>
        <p>Arma 3 takes place in the Arma series' fictional universe, set in the near future of the 2030s, during a period of global instability following decades of Western isolationism. The main plot events are primarily set in the Aegean Sea island nation of the Republic of Altis and Stratis[b] in 2034 and 2035, with Beyond Hope set in 2026, Old Man set in 2038, and First Contact set in 2039.</p>
        <p>The two primary factions in Arma 3 are the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the opposing Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT; based on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation).[16][c] Other factions include the Altis Armed Forces (AAF), the military of Altis and Stratis who rule the country under a junta; the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), a loyalist rebel militia led by Altis and Stratis' democratic government in exile; the Combat Technology Research Group (CTRG), NATO's classified black operations special forces unit; the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP), a humanitarian aid non-governmental organization; the Gendarmerie, the Horizon Islands' gendarmerie and defense force; Syndikat, a Tanoan criminal organization that later reforms into L'Ensemble, a guerilla army that is officially anti-imperialist but practically no different from its predecessor; and the Livonian Defense Force (LDF), Livonia's NATO-equipped military. Factions are sorted into three forces: BLUFOR (NATO and allies), REDFOR (CSAT and allies), and INDFOR (independent forces that are not officially part of either side).</p>
        <p>The plot of Arma 3 takes place over a variety of campaigns, showcase missions, and scenarios. The story is primarily told across eight campaigns: Prologue, The East Wind, Remnants of War, Apex Protocol, Old Man, Tac-Ops, Altis Requiem, and First Contact. Only Prologue and The East Wind are available in the base game, while the rest require their respective DLCs; additionally, the events of First Contact are considered non-canon.</p>

        <p>Play online in various multiplayer modes. Enter the multiplayer server browser by navigating through the Multiplayer tab in the Main Menu.</p>
        <p>Quick Play: The Quick Play feature finds a best-suited server for you and connects you to it. If you play the game with mods, it will try to find a server with the same combination of mods.
Navigate from the Main Menu via the Quick Play tab. You can specify a preferred game type or leave it to Any for the broadest set of possible connections. Selecting the Best Server option will go through all available servers and connect you to the best suiting ones. Connecting with the Best Server option may be slower than with the First Server option, but the gameplay should suffer fewer latency problems.</p>
        <p>Servers: Double-click a session listed in the browser, or use the Join button with a session already selected.
In the Role Assignment dialog, you can choose the side and the role just by clicking them. Note that sometimes the session host will determine your side or role. When you are ready to start, click the OK button, which will notify the other players, or directly start the game that is already in progress.</p>
        <p>Direct Connect: If you would like to join a specific host, click the Direct Connect button and enter the host’s address and port number.</p>
        <p>Host Server: To host your own session, click the Host Server button in the browser. You will be asked to select an existing scenario on any of the terrains or to create a new one with the Eden Editor. Having done this, you will find yourself in the Role Assignment dialog, where you can assign player roles.</p>
        <p>Zeus: Zeus presents one or more players with a toolbox that they can use to directly influence the session at hand.
Choose from either an existing rule set – such as the Seize and Defend modes, wherein Game Masters try to thwart or assist the players as they progress through the session – or the no-rules Game Master modes, where players are free to create entire scenarios as they see fit.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Eden_Editor">
        <header>Eden Editor</header>
        <p>Arma 3’s built-in editor is a powerful tool for creating and editing both singleplayer and multiplayer scenarios. Its several modes allow placing objects, playable and AI units and groups of units, setting up different types of waypoints and triggers, synchronizing them and editing all their parameters, all in the 3D scene. The editor also offers various modules that make editing easier and help to build complex scenario structures without deep knowledge of Real Virtuality’s scripting language.</p>
        <p>Since weather conditions and time of day are also crucial for gameplay, the Editor allows you to set all of the weather features that the Real Virtuality engine supports like overcast, dynamic wind, rain, lightning, waves and fog.</p>
        <p>Besides loading and saving, it is also possible to merge and export scenarios. You can publish scenarios directly to steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshopsubmitinfo and share them with other players. Managing published scenarios is done in the same way as updating them directly, via the Eden Editor.</p>
        <p>The Eden Editor is a powerful and comprehensive tool that is easy to use at the same time. Check out the in-editor tutorials, or inspect the community.bohemia.net/wiki/Eden_Editor to start creating your own Arma 3 scenarios!</p>
